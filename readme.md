# Hoverable Sidenav Buttons (HTML + CSS)

This project demonstrates a simple yet interactive **hoverable side navigation bar** using only HTML and CSS. When you hover over the buttons on the left side, they smoothly slide out into view.

## 🚀 Features

- Four color-coded vertical buttons (Green, Blue, Red, Gray)
- Smooth slide-in animation on hover
- Pure HTML and CSS (no JavaScript required)
- Demonstrates absolute positioning and CSS transitions

## 🖥️ How It Works

- Buttons are placed off-screen using `left: -100px`
- On hover, `left: 0` brings the button into view
- Each button has a unique `top` value and background color
